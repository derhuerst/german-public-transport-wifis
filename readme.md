## Installation

If you're using JavaScript, install [from npm](https://npmjs.com/package/german-public-transport-wifis):

```shell
npm install german-public-transport-wifis
```

Otherwise, download from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/derhuerst/german-public-transport-wifis/releases).


## Usage

`data.ndjson` is a [newline-delimited JSON](http://ndjson.org/) file, in which **each line describes a single [wireless access point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point) (AP).** The markup looks like this:

```js
{
	"station": "731380", // U Berliner Str., Berlin
	"stop": null,
	"platforms": [{
		"name": null,
		"line": "U9",
		"direction": "731371", // U GÃ¼ntzelstr., Berlin
		"position": 0.25
	}],
	"location": null,
	"bssid": "00:81:c4:e6:6c:df",
	"mac": null,
	"operator": "bvg"
}
```

- `station`: The ID of the *station* where the AP is located. Use [`db-dep --show-ids`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/db-cli) to find them.
- `stop`: The ID of the *stop* (part of the *station*) where the AP is located. Optional.
- `platforms`: An array of platforms the AP covers.
	- `name`: The name of the platform. Example: `3a`.
	- `line`: The name of a line that uniquely identifies the platform (because it usually runs there).
	- `direction`: The ID of the next *station* that the line will stop at.
	- `position`: Position of the AP relative to the platform. `0` means "in the back" and `1` "in the front", according to `direction`.
- `location`: The geolocation of the AP as an object with `latitude` and `longitude`. Optional.
- `bssid`: The [BSSID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)#Basic_service_sets_(BSSs)) of the AP.
- `mac`: The [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address#Usage_in_hosts) of the AP. Optional.
- `operator`: A string that uniquely identifies the transit operator running the WiFi (not the provider of WiFi infrastructure). Optional.
